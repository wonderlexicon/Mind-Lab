                This site is designed to show you a mirror of your mind. <p></p>
                You will witness, in real time, the processes through
                which you understand, experience, and interact with the world. <p>

                </p>This method of active self inquiry can evolve
                into a radically creative exercise in self determination - an unabashed 'F*ck You' to life on autopilot.
                <p></p> Obstacles transform into doorways, and adversaries into teachers. <p></p> All it requires is
                <i>practice, curiosity, and a
                    willingness to tell yourself the truth.</i>
