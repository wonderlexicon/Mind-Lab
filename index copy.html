       <h1> WELCOME TO THE MIND LAB
    </h1>
    <p>
    This site is designed to show you a mirror of your mind. You will witness, in real time, the processes through which you understand, experience, and interact with the world. This method of active self inquiry can evolve into a radically creative exercise in self determination - an unabashed 'F*ck You' to life on autopilot. Obstacles transform into doorways, and adversaries into teachers. All it requires is practice, curiosity, and the willingness to tell yourself the truth.    
</p>
    <!-- PAGE WELCOME -->
    <!-- ADD: Want to write short explanation about the concept/purpose of cognitive reframing. QUESTION: How do I increase the margins on both sides? How do I get rid of the space between WELCOME and QUOTE?-->

This will be the object of your inquiry. A circumstance can be anything that exists in the world. Your language should be as specific, objective and precise as possible when stating your circumstance. Don't worry. This is not a sterile process. You can be subjective in the next step!
